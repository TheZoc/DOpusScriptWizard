# Directory Opus - Script Wizard

This script is based on the original [ScriptWizard](https://resource.dopus.com/t/command-scriptwizard-multipurpose-scripting-resources-aid/19326) and is a work in progress to fix the script, broken by the forum upgrade on [Directory Opus Resource Centre](https://resource.dopus.com/)

## Introduction:

ScriptWizard is a script addin which helps to keep your other script addins uptodate. It is able to automatically download newer versions if requested and generally helps in up-/downloading, maintaining and writing directory opus script add-ins. Wether you're a script writer or not, I recommend adding this to your dopus installation, as it offers some comfort for everyone.
